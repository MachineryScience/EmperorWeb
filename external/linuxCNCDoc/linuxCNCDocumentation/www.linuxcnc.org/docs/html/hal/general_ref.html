<h2 id="cha:general-reference">1. General Naming Conventions<a id="sec:GR-Naming-Conventions"></a></h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Consistent naming conventions would make HAL much easier to use. For
example, if every encoder driver provided the same set of pins and
named them the same way it would be easy to change from one type of
encoder driver to another. Unfortunately, like many open-source
projects, HAL is a combination of things that were designed, and things
that simply evolved. As a result, there are many inconsistencies. This
section attempts to address that problem by defining some conventions,
but it will probably be a while before all the modules are converted to
follow them.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Halcmd and other low-level HAL utilities treat HAL names as single
entities, with no internal structure. However, most modules do have
some implicit structure. For example, a board provides several
functional blocks, each block might have several channels, and each
channel has one or more pins. This results in a structure that
resembles a directory tree. Even though halcmd doesn&#8217;t recognize the
tree structure, proper choice of naming conventions will let it group
related items together (since it sorts the names). In addition, higher
level tools can be designed to recognize such structure, if the names
provide the necessary information. To do that, all HAL components should
follow these rules:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Dots (“.”) separate levels of the hirearchy.
   This is analogous to the slash (“/”) in a filename.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Hyphens (“-”) separate words or fields in the same level of the hirearchy.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
HAL components should not use underscores or “MixedCase”.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Use only lowercase letters and numbers in names.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>

<h3 id="_pin_parameter_names">2.1. Pin/Parameter names</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Hardware drivers should use five fields (on three levels) to make up a
pin or parameter name, as follows:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><tt><strong>&lt;device-name&gt;.&lt;device-num&gt;.&lt;io-type&gt;.&lt;chan-num&gt;.&lt;specific-name&gt;</strong></tt></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The individual fields are:</p></div>
<div class="dlist"><dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">
&lt;device-name&gt;
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
      The device that the driver is intended to work with. This is most
    often an interface board of some type, but there are other
    possibilities.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
&lt;device-num&gt;
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
      It is possible to install more than one servo board, parallel port,
    or other hardware device in a computer. The device number identifies a
    specific device. Device numbers start at 0 and increment.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
&lt;io-type&gt;
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
      Most devices provide more than one type of I/O. Even the simple
    parallel port has both digital inputs and digital outputs. More complex
    boards can have digital inputs and outputs, encoder counters, pwm or
    step pulse generators, analog-to-digital converters, digital-to-analog
    converters, or other unique capabilities. The I/O type is used to
    identify the kind of I/O that a pin or parameter is associated with.
    Ideally, drivers that implement the same I/O type, even if for very
    different devices, should provide a consistent set of pins and
    parameters and identical behavior. For example, all digital inputs
    should behave the same when seen from inside the HAL, regardless of the
    device.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
&lt;chan-num&gt;
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
      Virtually every I/O device has multiple channels, and the channel
    number identifies one of them. Like device numbers, channel numbers
    start at zero and increment.<span class="footnote"><br />[One exception to the
    “channel numbers start at zero” rule is
    the parallel port. Its HAL pins are numbered with the corresponding pin
    number on the DB-25 connector. This is convenient for wiring, but
    inconsistent with other drivers. There is some debate over whether this
    is a bug or a feature.]<br /></span>
    If more than one device is installed, the channel numbers on
    additional devices start over at zero. If it is possible to have a
    channel number greater than 9, then channel numbers should be two
    digits, with a leading zero on numbers less than 10 to preserve sort
    ordering. Some modules have pins and/or parameters that affect more
    than one channel. For example a PWM generator might have four channels
    with four independent “duty-cycle” inputs, but one “frequency”
    parameter that controls all four channels (due to hardware
    limitations). The frequency parameter should use “0-3” as the channel
    number.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
&lt;specific-name&gt;
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
      An individual I/O channel might have just a single HAL pin associated
    with it, but most have more than one. For example, a digital input has
    two pins, one is the state of the physical pin, the other is the same
    thing inverted. That allows the configurator to choose between active
    high and active low inputs. For most io-types, there is a standard set
    of pins and parameters, (referred to as the “canonical interface”) that
    the driver should implement. The canonical interfaces are described in
    the <a href="canonical-devices.html#cha:Canonical-Device-Interfaces">Canonical Device Interfaces</a>
    chapter.

<h3 id="_function_names">2.2. Function Names</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Hardware drivers usually only have two kinds of HAL functions, ones
that read the hardware and update HAL pins, and ones that write to the
hardware using data from HAL pins. They should be named as follows:</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><tt><strong>&lt;device-name&gt;-&lt;device-num&gt;.&lt;io-type&gt;-&lt;chan-num-range&gt;.read|write</strong></tt></p></div>
<div class="dlist"><dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">
&lt;device-name&gt;
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
     The same as used for pins and parameters.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
&lt;device-num&gt;
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
     The specific device that the function will access.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
&lt;io-type&gt;
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
      Optional. A function may access all of the I/O on a board, or it may
    access only a certain type. For example, there may be independent
    functions for reading encoder counters and reading digital I/O. If such
    independent functions exist, the &lt;io-type&gt; field identifies the type of
    I/O they access. If a single function reads all I/O provided by the
    board, &lt;io-type&gt; is not used.
    <span class="footnote"><br />[Note to driver programmers: do NOT implement separate
    functions for different I/O types unless they are interruptible and can
    work in independent threads. If interrupting an encoder read, reading
    digital inputs, and then resuming the encoder read will cause problems,
    then implement a single function that does everything.]<br /></span>
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
&lt;chan-num-range&gt;
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
    Optional. Used only if the &lt;io-type&gt; I/O is broken into groups and
    accessed by different functions.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
read|write
</dt>

<p>
     Indicates whether the function reads the hardware or writes to it.
