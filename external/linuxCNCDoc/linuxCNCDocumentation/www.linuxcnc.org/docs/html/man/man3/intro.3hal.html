Introduction to the HAL API</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION
<a name="DESCRIPTION"></a>
</h2>


<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">HAL stands for
Hardware Abstraction Layer, and is used by LinuxCNC to
transfer realtime data to and from I/O devices and other
low-level modules.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em"><b>hal.h</b>
defines the API and data structures used by the HAL. This
file is included in both realtime and non-realtime HAL
components. HAL uses the RTPAI real time interface, and the
#define symbols RTAPI and ULAPI are used to distinguish
between realtime and non-realtime code. The API defined in
this file is implemented in hal_lib.c and can be compiled
for linking to either realtime or user space HAL
components.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">The HAL is a
very modular approach to the low level parts of a motion
control system. The goal of the HAL is to allow a systems
integrator to connect a group of software components
together to meet whatever I/O requirements he (or she)
needs. This includes realtime and non-realtime I/O, as well
as basic motor control up to and including a PID position
loop. What these functions have in common is that they all
process signals. In general, a signal is a data item that is
updated at regular intervals. For example, a PID loop gets
position command and feedback signals, and produces a
velocity command signal.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">HAL is based on
the approach used to design electronic circuits. In
electronics, off-the-shelf components like integrated
circuits are placed on a circuit board and their pins are
interconnected to build whatever overall function is needed.
The individual components may be as simple as an op-amp, or
as complex as a digital signal processor. Each component can
be individually tested, to make sure it works as designed.
After the components are placed in a larger circuit, the
signals connecting them can still be monitored for testing
and troubleshooting.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Like electronic
components, HAL components have pins, and the pins can be
interconnected by signals.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">In the HAL, a
<i>signal</i> contains the actual data value that passes
from one pin to another. When a signal is created, space is
allocated for the data value. A <i>pin</i> on the other
hand, is a pointer, not a data value. When a pin is
connected to a signal, the pin&rsquo;s pointer is set to
point at the signal&rsquo;s data value. This allows the
component to access the signal with very little run-time
overhead. (If a pin is not linked to any signal, the pointer
points to a dummy location, so the realtime code
doesn&rsquo;t have to deal with null pointers or treat
unlinked variables as a special case in any way.)</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">There are three
approaches to writing a HAL component. Those that do not
require hard realtime performance can be written as a single
user mode process. Components that need hard realtime
performance but have simple configuration and init
requirements can be done as a single kernel module, using
either pre-defined init info, or insmod-time parameters.
Finally, complex components may use both a kernel module for
the realtime part, and a user space process to handle ini
file access, user interface (possibly including GUI
features), and other details.</p>

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">HAL uses the
RTAPI/ULAPI interface. If RTAPI is #defined hal_lib.c would
generate a kernel module hal_lib.o that is insmoded and
provides the functions for all kernel module based
components. The same source file compiled with the ULAPI
#define would make a user space hal_lib.o that is staticlly
linked to user space code to make user space executables.
The variable lists and link information are stored in a
block of shared memory and protected with mutexes, so that
kernel modules and any of several user mode programs can
access the data.</p>

<h2>HAL STATUS CODES

<p style="margin-left:11%; margin-top: 1em">Except as noted
in specific manual pages, HAL returns negative errno values
for errors, and nonnegative values for success.</p>
