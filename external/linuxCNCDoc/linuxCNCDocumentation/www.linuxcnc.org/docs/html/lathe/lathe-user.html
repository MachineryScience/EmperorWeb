<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>The "Tool Table" is a text file that contains information about each tool.
The file is located in the same directory as your configuration and is called "tool.tbl" by default.
The tools might be in a tool changer or just changed manually.
The file can be edited with a text editor or be updated using G10 L1,L10,L11.
There is also a built-in tool table editor in the Axis display.
The maximum number of entries in the tool table is 56.
The maximum tool and pocket number is 99999.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Earlier versions of LinuxCNC had two different tool table formats for mills and lathes,
but since the 2.4.x release, one tool table format is used for all machines.
Just ignore the parts of the tool table that don&#8217;t pertain to your machine,
or which you don&#8217;t need to use.

<h2 id="_tool_touch_off">4. Tool Touch Off</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>When running in lathe mode in AXIS you can set the X and Z in the tool
table using the Touch Off window.</p></div>
<h3 id="_the_x_tool_offset">4.1. The X Tool Offset</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The X axis offset for each tool is normally an offset
from the center line of the spindle.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>One method is to take your normal turning tool and
turn down some stock to a known diameter.
Using the Tool Touch Off window enter the measured diameter
(or radius if in radius mode) for that tool.
Then using some layout fluid or a marker to coat the part
bring each tool up
till it just touches the dye and set it&#8217;s X offset to
the diameter of the part used using the tool touch off.
Make sure any tools in the corner quadrants have the nose radius
set properly in the tool table so the control point is correct.
Tool touch off automatically adds a G43
so the current tool is the current offset.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A typical session might be:</p></div>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>
Home each axis if not homed.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Set the current tool with "Tn M6" where "n" is the tool number.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Select the X axis in the Manual Control window.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Move the X to a known position or take a test cut and measure the diameter.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Select Touch Off and pick Tool Table then enter the position or the diameter.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Follow the same sequence to correct the Z axis.
</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Note: if you are in Radius Mode you must enter the radius, not the diameter.</p></div>
<h3 id="_the_z_tool_offset">4.2. The Z Tool Offset</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The Z axis offsets can be a bit confusing at first
because there are two elements to the Z offset.
There is the tool table offset, and the machine coordinate offset.
First we will look at the tool table offsets.
One method is to use a fixed point on your lathe and
set the Z offset for all tools from this point.
Some use the spindle nose or chuck face.
This gives you the ability to change to a new tool and
set its Z offset without having to reset all the tools.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A typical session might be:</p></div>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>
Home each axis if not homed.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Make sure no offsets are in effect for the current coordinate system.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Set the current tool with "TnM6" where "n" is the tool number.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Select the Z axis in the Manual Control window.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Bring the tool close to the control surface. Using a cylinder move the
   Z away from the control surface until the cylinder just passes between
   the tool and the control surface.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Select Touch Off and pick Tool Table and set the position to 0.0.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Repeat for each tool using the same cylinder.
</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Now all the tools are offset the same distance from a standard position.
If you change a tool like a drill bit you repeat the above and
it is now in sync with the rest of the tools for Z offset.
Some tools might require a bit of cyphering to determine
the control point from the touch off point.
For example, if you have a 0.125" wide parting tool and
you touch the left side off but want the right to be Z0,
then enter 0.125" in the touch off window.</p></div>
<h3 id="_the_z_machine_offset">4.3. The Z Machine Offset</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Once all the tools have the Z offset entered into the tool table,
you can use any tool to set the machine offset
using the machine coordinate system.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A typical session might be:</p></div>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>
Home each axis if not homed.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Set the current tool with "Tn M6" where "n" is the tool number.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Issue a G43 so the current tool offset is in effect.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Bring the tool to the work piece and set the machine Z offset.
</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you forget to set the G43 for the current tool when you set the
machine coordinate system offset, you will not get what you expect,
as the tool offset will be added to the current offset when
the tool is used in your program.</p></div>
</div>
<h2 id="_spindle_synchronized_motion">5. Spindle Synchronized Motion</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Spindle synchronized motion requires a quadrature encoder connected
to the spindle with one index pulse per revolution. See the motion
man page and Spindle Control Example in integrators manual for more
information.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">Threading</div><p>The G76 threading cycle is used for both internal and external threads.
For more information see the <a href="../gcode/gcode.html#sec:G76-Threading-Canned">G76</a> Section.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">Constant Surface Speed</div><p>CSS or Constant Surface Speed uses the machine X origin modified
by the tool X offset to compute the spindle speed in RPM. CSS will
track changes in tool offsets. The X machine origin should be when the
reference tool (the one with zero offset) is at the center of rotation.
For more information see the <a href="../gcode/gcode.html#sec:G96-G97-Spindle">G96</a> Section.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">Feed per Revolution</div><p>Feed per revolution will move the Z axis by the F amount per revolution.
This is not for threading, use G76 for threading.
For more information see the <a href="../gcode/gcode.html#sec:G93-G94-G95-Mode">G95</a> Section.</p></div>
</div>
<h2 id="_arcs">6. Arcs</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Calculating arcs can be mind challenging enough without considering
radius and diameter mode on lathes as well as machine coordinate system
orientation. The following applies to center format arcs. On a lathe
you should include G18 in your preamble as the default is G17 even if
you&#8217;re in lathe mode, in the user interface Axis. Arcs in G18 XZ plane
use I (X axis) and K (Z axis) offsets.</p></div>
<h3 id="_arcs_and_lathe_design">6.1. Arcs and Lathe Design</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The typical lathe has the spindle on the left of the operator and the
tools on the operator side of the spindle center line. This is
typically set up with the imaginary Y axis (+) pointing at the floor.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The following will be true on this type of setup:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
The Z axis (+) points to the right, away from the spindle.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The X axis (+) points toward the operator, and when on the operator
   side of the spindle the X values are positive.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Some lathes with tools on the back side have the imaginary Y axis (+)
pointing up.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>G2/G3 Arc directions are based on the axis they rotate around. In the
case of lathes, it is the imaginary Y axis. If the Y axis (+) points
toward the floor, you have to look up for the arc to appear to go in the
correct direction. So looking from above you reverse the G2/G3 for the
arc to appear to go in the correct direction.</p></div>
<h3 id="_radius_amp_diameter_mode">6.2. Radius &amp; Diameter Mode</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When calculating arcs in radius mode you only have to remember the
direction of rotation as it applies to your lathe.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When calculating arcs in diameter mode X is diameter and the X offset
(I) is radius even if you&#8217;re in G7 diameter mode.</p></div>
</div>
<h2 id="_tool_path">7. Tool Path</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<h3 id="_control_point">7.1. Control Point</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The control point for the tool follows the programmed path. The
control point is the intersection of a line parallel to the X and Z
axis and tangent to the tool tip diameter, as defined when you touch
off the X and Z axes for that tool. When turning or facing straight
sided parts the cutting path and the tool edge follow the same path.
When turning radius and angles the edge of the tool tip will not follow
the programmed path unless cutter comp is in effect. In the following
figures you can see how the control point does not follow the tool edge
as you might assume.</p></div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/control_point.png" alt="images/control_point.png" />
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 4. Control Point<a id="fig:Control-Point"></a></div>
</div>
<h3 id="_cutting_angles_without_cutter_comp">7.2. Cutting Angles without Cutter Comp</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Now imagine we program a ramp without cutter comp. The programmed path
is shown in the following figure. As you can see in the figure the
programmed path and the desired cut path are one and the same as long
as we are moving in an X or Z direction only.</p></div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ramp_entry.png" alt="images/ramp_entry.png" />
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 5. Ramp Entry</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Now as the control point progresses along the programmed path the
actual cutter edge does not follow the programmed path as shown in the
following figure. There are two ways to solve this, cutter comp and
adjusting your programmed path to compensate for tip radius.</p></div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/ramp_cut.png" alt="images/ramp_cut.png" />
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 6. Ramp Path</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In the above example it is a simple exercise to adjust the programmed
path to give the desired actual path by moving the programmed path for
the ramp to the left the radius of the tool tip.</p></div>
<h3 id="_cutting_a_radius">7.3. Cutting a Radius</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In this example we will examine what happens during a radius cut
without cutter comp. In the next figure you see the tool turning the OD
of the part. The control point of the tool is following the programmed
path and the tool is touching the OD of the part.</p></div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/radius_1.png" alt="images/radius_1.png" />
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 7. Turning Cut</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In this next figure you can see as the tool approaches the end of the
part the control point still follows the path but the tool tip has left
the part and is cutting air. You can also see that even though a radius
has been programmed the part will actually end up with a square corner.</p></div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/radius_2.png" alt="images/radius_2.png" />
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 8. Radius Cut</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Now you can see as the control point follows the radius programmed the
tool tip has left the part and is now cutting air.</p></div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/radius_3.png" alt="images/radius_3.png" />
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 9. Radius Cut</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In the final figure we can see the tool tip will finish cutting the
face but leave a square corner instead of a nice radius. Notice also
that if you program the cut to end at the center of the part a small
amount of material will be left from the radius of the tool. To finish
a face cut to the center of a part you have to program the tool to go
past center at least the nose radius of the tool.</p></div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/radius_4.png" alt="images/radius_4.png" />
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 10. Face Cut</div>
</div>
<h3 id="_using_cutter_comp">7.4. Using Cutter Comp</h3><div style="clear:left"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>When using cutter comp on a lathe think of the tool tip radius as the
radius of a round cutter. When using cutter comp the path must be large
enough for a round tool that will not gouge into the next line. When
cutting straight lines on the lathe you might not want to use cutter
comp. For example boring a hole with a tight fitting boring bar you may
not have enough room to do the exit move. The entry move into a cutter
comp arc is important to get the correct results.</p></div>
