meaning and several additional meanings for users, installers, and
developers.</p></div>
<div class="dlist"><dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">
Acme Screw
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
     <a id="glo:AcmeScrew"></a> A type of lead-screw that uses an Acme
    thread form. Acme threads have somewhat lower friction and wear than
    simple triangular threads, but ball-screws are lower yet. Most manual
    machine tools use acme lead-screws.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
Axis
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
     <a id="glo:Axis"></a> One of the computer controlled movable parts of the
    machine. For a typical vertical mill, the table is the X axis, the
    saddle is the Y axis, and the quill or knee is the Z axis. Angular
    axes like rotary tables are referred to as A, B, and C. Additional
    linear axes relative to the tool are called U, V, and W
    respectively.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
Axis(GUI)
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
      One of the Graphical User Interfaces available to users of
    LinuxCNC. It features the modern use of menus and mouse buttons while
    automating and hiding some of the more traditional LinuxCNC controls. It is
    the only open-source interface that displays the entire tool path as
    soon as a file is opened.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
Backlash
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
     <a id="glo:Backlash"></a> The amount of "play" or lost motion that
    occurs when direction is reversed in a lead screw. or other mechanical
    motion driving system. It can result from nuts that are loose on
    leadscrews, slippage in belts, cable slack, "wind-up" in rotary
    couplings, and other places where the mechanical system is not "tight".
    Backlash will result in inaccurate motion, or in the case of motion
    caused by external forces (think cutting tool pulling on the work
    piece) the result can be broken cutting tools. This can happen because
    of the sudden increase in chip load on the cutter as the work piece is
    pulled across the backlash distance by the cutting tool.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
Backlash Compensation
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
      Any technique that attempts to reduce
    the effect of backlash without actually removing it from the mechanical
    system. This is typically done in software in the controller. This can
    correct the final resting place of the part in motion but fails to
    solve problems related to direction changes while in motion (think
    circular interpolation) and motion that is caused when external forces
    (think cutting tool pulling on the work piece) are the source of the
    motion.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
Ball Screw
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
     <a id="glo:Ballscrew"></a> A type of lead-screw that uses small
    hardened steel balls between the nut and screw to reduce friction.
    Ball-screws have very low friction and backlash, but are usually quite
    expensive.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
Ball Nut
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
     <a id="glo:Ballnut"></a> A special nut designed for use with a
    ball-screw. It contains an internal passage to re-circulate the balls
    from one end of the screw to the other.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
CNC
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
     <a id="glo:CNC"></a> Computer Numerical Control. The general term used to
    refer to computer control of machinery. Instead of a human operator
    turning cranks to move a cutting tool, CNC uses a computer and motors
    to move the tool, based on a part program.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
Comp
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
     <a id="glo:comp"></a> A tool used to build, compile and install LinuxCNC HAL
    components.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
Configuration(n)
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
     A directory containing a set of configuration files. Custom
    configurations are normally saved in the users home/linuxcnc/configs
    directory. These files include LinuxCNC&#8217;s traditional INI file and HAL
    files. A configuration may also contain several general files that
    describe tools, parameters, and NML connections.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
Configuration(v)
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
     The task of setting up LinuxCNC so that it matches the hardware on a
    machine tool.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
Coordinate Measuring Machine
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
      A Coordinate Measuring Machine is
    used to make many accurate measurements on parts. These machines can be
    used to create CAD data for parts where no drawings can be found, when
    a hand-made prototype needs to be digitized for moldmaking, or to check
    the accuracy of machined or molded parts.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
Display units
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
      The linear and angular units used for onscreen
    display.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
DRO
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
      A Digital Read Out is a system of position-measuring devices
    attached to the slides of a machine tool, which are connected to a
    numeric display showing the current location of the tool with respect to
    some reference position.
    DROs are very popular on hand-operated machine tools because they
    measure the true tool position without backlash, even if the machine
    has very loose Acme screws.
    Some DROs use linear quadrature encoders to pick up position
    information from the machine, and some use methods similar to a
    resolver which keeps rolling over.
</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">
EDM
</dt>
<dd>
<p>
      EDM is a method of removing metal in hard or difficult to
    machine or tough metals, or where rotating tools would not be able to
    produce the desired shape in a cost-effective manner. An excellent
    example is rectangular punch dies, where sharp internal corners are
    desired. Milling operations can not give sharp internal corners with
    finite diameter tools. A <em>wire</em> EDM machine can make internal corners
    with a radius only slightly larger than the wire&#8217;s radius. A <em>sinker</em>
    EDM can make internal corners with a radius only slightly larger
    than the radius on the corner of the sinking electrode.

    Fixture offsets can be used to shift the actual execution point
    of that gcode program to properly fit the true location
