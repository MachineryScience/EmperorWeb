<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Classic Ladder is a free implementation of a ladder interpreter,
released under the LGPL. It was written by Marc Le Douarain.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>He describes the beginning of the project on his website:</p></div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<div class="quoteblock-content">
<div class="paragraph"><p>I decided to program a ladder language only for test purposes at the
start, in February 2001. It was planned, that I would have to
participate to a new product after leaving the enterprise in which I
was working at that time. And I was thinking that to have a ladder
language in those products could be a nice option to considerate. And
so I started to code the first lines for calculating a rung with
minimal elements and displaying dynamically it under Gtk, to see if my
first idea to realize all this works.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>And as quickly I&#8217;ve found that it advanced quite well, I&#8217;ve continued
with more complex elements: timer, multiples rungs, etc&#8230;</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Voila, here is this work&#8230; and more: I&#8217;ve continued to add features
since then.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>Classic Ladder has been adapted to work with LinuxCNC&#8217;s HAL, and is
currently being distributed along with LinuxCNC. If there are
issues/problems/bugs please report them to the Enhanced Machine
Controller project.</p></div>
</div>
<h2 id="_introduction">2. Introduction</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Ladder logic or the Ladder programming language is a method of drawing
electrical logic schematics. It is now a graphical language very
popular for programming Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs). It was
originally invented to describe logic made from relays. The name is
based on the observation that programs in this language resemble
ladders, with two vertical <em>rails</em> and a series of horizontal <em>rungs</em>
between them. In Germany and elsewhere in Europe, the style is to
draw the rails horizontally along the top and bottom of the page
while the rungs are drawn vertically from left to right.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>A program in ladder logic, also called a ladder diagram, is similar to
a schematic for a set of relay circuits. Ladder logic is useful because
a wide variety of engineers and technicians can understand and use it
without much additional training because of the resemblance.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Ladder logic is widely used to program PLCs, where sequential control
of a process or manufacturing operation is required. Ladder logic is
useful for simple but critical control systems, or for reworking old
hardwired relay circuits. As programmable logic controllers became more
sophisticated it has also been used in very complex automation systems.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Ladder logic can be thought of as a rule-based language, rather than a
procedural language. A <em>rung</em> in the ladder represents a rule. When
implemented with relays and other electromechanical devices, the
various rules <em>execute</em> simultaneously and immediately. When
implemented in a programmable logic controller, the rules are typically
executed sequentially by software, in a loop. By executing the loop
fast enough, typically many times per second, the effect of
simultaneous and immediate execution is obtained.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Ladder logic follows these general steps for operation.</p></div>

<h2 id="_example">3. Example</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>The most common components of ladder are contacts (inputs), these
usually are either NC (normally closed) or NO (normally open), and
coils (outputs).</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>

</span>

</li>
<li>
<p>
the NC contact <span class="image">
<img src="images/ladder_action_loadbar.png" alt="images/ladder_action_loadbar.png" />
</span>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
the coil (output) <span class="image">
<img src="images/ladder_action_out.png" alt="images/ladder_action_out.png" />
</span>
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Of course there are many more components to a full ladder language,
but understanding these will help you grasp the overall concept.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The ladder consists of one or more rungs. These rungs are horizontal
traces (representing wires), with components on them (inputs,
outputs and other), which get evaluated left to right.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This example is the simplest rung:</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/example_link_contact_coil.png" alt="images/example_link_contact_coil.png" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The input on the left, B0, a normally open contact, is connected to the
coil (output) on the right, Q0. Now imagine a voltage gets applied to the
leftmost end, because the input B0 turns true (e.g. the input is
activated, or the user pushed the NO contact). The voltage has a direct
path to reach the coil (output) on the right, Q0.
As a consequence, the Q0 coil (output) will turn from 0/off/false
to 1/on/true.
If the user releases B0, the Q0 output quickly returns to 0/off/false.</p></div>
</div>
<h2 id="_basic_latching_on_off_circuit">4. Basic Latching On-Off Circuit</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Building on the above example, suppose we add a switch that closes
whenever the coil Q0 is active. This would be the case in a relay,
where the coil can activate the switch contacts; or in a contactor,
where there are often several small auxilliary contacts
in addition to the large 3-phase contacts that are the
primary feature of the contactor.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Since this auxilliary switch is driven from coil Q0 in our earlier
example, we will give it the same number as the coil that drives it.
This is the standard practice followed in all ladder programming,
although it may seem strange at first to see a switch labeled the
same as a coil. So let&#8217;s call this auxilliary contact Q0 and
connect it across the B0 <em>pushbutton</em> contact from our earlier example.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Let&#8217;s take a look at it:</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/example_link_contact_coil2.png" alt="images/example_link_contact_coil2.png" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>As before, when the user presses pushbutton B0, coil Q0 comes on.
And when coil Q0 comes on, switch Q0 comes on. Now the interesting
part happens. When the user releases pushbutton B0, coil Q0
does not stop as it did before. This is because switch Q0
of this circuit is effectively holding the user&#8217;s pushbutton
pressed. So we see that switch Q0 is still holding coil Q0 on
after the <em>start</em> pushbutton has been released.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This type of contact on a coil or relay, used in this way, is
often called a <em>holding contact</em>, because it <em>holds on</em> the
coil that it is associated with. It is also occasionally called
a <em>seal</em> contact, and when it is active it is said that the
circuit is <em>sealed</em>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Unfortunately, our circuit so far has little practical use,
because, although we have an <em>on</em> or <em>start</em> button in the form of
pushbutton B0, we have no way to shut this circuit off once
it is started. But that&#8217;s easy to fix. All we need is a way to
interrupt the power to coil Q0. So let&#8217;s add a normally-closed
(NC) pushbutton just ahead of coil Q0.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Here&#8217;s how that would look:</p></div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align:center;">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/example_link_contact_coil3.png" alt="images/example_link_contact_coil3.png" />
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Now we have added <em>off</em> or <em>stop</em> pushbutton B1. If the user
pushes it, contact from the rung to the coil is broken.
When coil Q0 loses power, it drops to 0/off/false. When
coil Q0 goes off, so does switch Q0, so the <em>holding contact</em>
is broken, or the circuit is <em>unsealed</em>. When the user releases
the <em>stop</em> pushbutton, contact is restored from the rung to
coil Q0, but the rung has gone dead, so the coil doesn&#8217;t
come back on.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This circuit has been used for decades on virtually every
machine that has a three-phase motor controlled by
a contactor, so it was inevitable that it would be
adopted by ladder/PLC programmers. It is also a very safe
circuit, in that if <em>start</em> and <em>stop</em> are both pressed at
the same time, the <em>stop</em> function always wins.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This is the basic building block of much of ladder programming,
so if you are new to it, you would do well to make sure that
you understand how this circuit operates.</p></div>
