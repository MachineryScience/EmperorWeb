<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you need to ramp your spindle speed command and your control does
not have that feature it can be done in HAL. Basically you need to
hijack the output of motion.spindle-speed-out and run it through a
limit2 component with the scale set so it will ramp the rpm from
motion.spindle-speed-out to your device that receives the rpm. The
second part is to let LinuxCNC know when the spindle is at speed so motion
can begin.</p></div>

<div class="sidebar-title">Intro to HAL components limit2 and near:</div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>In case you have not run across them before, here&#8217;s a quick introduction
to the two HAL components used in the following example.</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
A "limit2" is a HAL component (floating point) that accepts an
   input value and provides an output that has been limited to a
   max/min range, and also limited to not exceed a specified
   rate of change.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A "near" is a HAL component (floating point) with a binary output
   that says whether two inputs are approximately equal.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>More info is available in the documentation for HAL components,
or from the man pages, just say <em>man limit2</em> or <em>man near</em> in a terminal.</p></div>
</div></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt># load real time a limit2 and a near with names so it is easier to follow
loadrt limit2 names=spindle-ramp
loadrt near names=spindle-at-speed

# add the functions to a thread

addf spindle-at-speed servo-thread

# set the parameter for max rate-of-change
# (max spindle accel/decel in units per second)
setp spindle-ramp.maxv 60

# hijack the spindle speed out and send it to spindle ramp in
net spindle-cmd &lt;= motion.spindle-speed-out =&gt; spindle-ramp.in

# the output of spindle ramp is sent to the scale in
net spindle-ramped &lt;= spindle-ramp.out =&gt; scale.0.in

# to know when to start the motion we send the near component
# (named spindle-at-speed) to the spindle commanded speed from
# the signal spindle-cmd and the actual spindle speed
# provided your spindle can accelerate at the maxv setting.

<div class="paragraph"><p></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Spindle feedback is needed by LinuxCNC to perform any spindle coordinated
motions like threading and constant surface speed. The StepConf Wizard
can perform the connections for you if you select Encoder Phase A and
Encoder Index as inputs.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Hardware assumptions:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
An encoder is connected to the spindle and puts out 100 pulses per
   revolution on phase A
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The encoder A phase is connected to the parallel port pin 10
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The encoder index pulse is connected to the parallel port pin 11
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Basic Steps to add the components and configure them:
<span class="footnote"><br />[In this example, we will assume that some encoders have already
been issued to axes/joints 0, 1, and 2. So the next encoder available for us
to attach to the spindle would be number 3. Your situation may differ.]<br /></span>
<span class="footnote"><br />[The HAL encoder index-enable is an exception to the rule in that
it behaves as both an input and an output, see manual for details]<br /></span>
<span class="footnote"><br />[It is because we selected <em>non-quadrature simple counting&#8230;</em> above
that we can get away with <em>quadrature</em> counting without having any
B quadrature input.]<br /></span></p></div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre><tt># add the encoder to HAL and attach it to threads.

<div class="paragraph"><p></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To enable LinuxCNC to wait for the spindle to be at speed before executing
a series of moves you need to set motion.spindle-at-speed to true when
the spindle is at the commanded speed. To do this you need spindle
feedback from an encoder. Since the feedback and the commanded speed
are not usually <em>exactly</em> the same you need to use the <em>near</em>
component to say that the two numbers are close enough.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The connections needed are from the spindle
velocity command signal to near.n.in1 and from the spindle velocity
from the encoder to near.n.in2. Then the near.n.out is connected to
motion.spindle-at-speed. The near.n.scale needs to be set to say how
close the two numbers must be before turning on the output. Depending
on your setup you may need to adjust the scale to work with your
hardware.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The following is typical of the additions needed to your HAL
file to enable Spindle At Speed. If you already have near in your HAL
file then increase the count and adjust code to suit. Check to make
sure the signal names are the same in your HAL file.</p></div>
